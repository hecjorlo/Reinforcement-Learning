# Reinforcement-Learning

MountainCar-v0 is an environment presented by OpenAI Gym. In this repository we have implemeted 2 different ways of solving the problem:
**1 - Q - learning:** simple algorithm that allows us to solve the problem very fast, but we have to discretize the environment.

**2 DQN:** this a more complex and slower to train algorithm. However, it can be apllied to much more complex environments as we don't need to discretize any continous space.
